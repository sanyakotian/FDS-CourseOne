# Introduction to the Unix/Linux Terminal and standard file system

Learning Goals:

* Learn about the Unix/Linux Terminal (or Windows terminal/console)
* Navigate the file system using the terminal
* Create a folders and a files with the terminal
* Learn about the standard filesystem on a computer (UNIX/Linux, macOS and Windows)

Prerequisites:

* Internet access
* A computer with a terminal application. Basically, any computer (even a Chromebook!)

### Reading overview
This short reading is a very simple introduction to your computer's terminal and the system of files and folders on your computer.
We will not attempt to cover the terminal exhaustively, instead, we will focus on the basics needed to get you started and help you use Git and GitHub.

## The Terminal
We are used to looking at and operate our personal computers using graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This means that we routinely open files or folders by first finding them using the "finder" (mac) or "browser" (Windows) graphical interface and then clicking on them. We perform a search using a search bar. We navigate the internet using a browesr such as Chrome, Firefox or Safari, we write documents using Google Docs or Microsoft Word. All these are examples of software that uses graphical user interfaces or GUIs. GUIs have revolutionized computers effectively making them accessable to anyone. Before GUIs, however, there was the `Terminal`.

##### Question: Do you know who started the personal computer revolution (name individuals or a company)? 

The terminal is the command line (text) interface to your computer file system and operative system. It is now referred to as interchangebly as the terminal, console, shell, or command line. They were called "terminals" because they were literally the end of the line - information from a centralized computer (a "main frame" - generally in another room or even another building) came out as far as the terminus or terminal, and no further. The earliest terminal was the ["teletypewriter" or "tty"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter), literally a modified typewriter. 

![The Teletypewriter, a.k.a TTY](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119795/151270216-53e6940c-48dd-48c6-899a-de7b395fc3b8.jpg)

[Image source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter)

Later a one-piece keyboard and monitor combination called a "console" took its place but, of course, these were also called terminals. The "shell" is the software that allows you to interact with the computer's operating system using terminal/console. It is mainly used to run other programs by typing the name of the program plus any options at the "command line", the place where your typing appears ([read here for more information](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)).

Today's "terminal/console" is not an antique thing you plug into your computer, but rather just a window on your desktop that looks and acts like the terminals of yore. But why would we want to seemingly step back in time like this? Because, despite the ease of use of the GUI interface to your computer, the terminal is powerful and often provides faster and easier ways of doing things once you get a little good at using it. In fact, there are still certain things that you can do using the terminal that you cannot do using the GUI.

##### Question: Do you know who broght back the terminal in the era of the personal computers (name individuals or a company and at least a couple of answers might be correct)? 

Most of the following examples will use Mac OSX to demonstrate how to access the Terminal and use basic shell commands. This is just because I happen to have access to a Mac OSX. If you are using Linux (Ubuntu for example) [here is a nice tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) on how to access and use the terminal. If you are using Windows, the terminal application is called the "console". If you are on Microsoft Windows 10 you might look into the [new Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/).

## Opening a terminal
In Mac OSX you can find the terminal using the search bar.

[![Example Video on How-To Find The Unix Terminal on Max PSX 10.5.x](https://img.youtube.com/vi/g-U1c2ojls8/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/g-U1c2ojls8)

After that, I suggest you add the Terminal Icon to your Dock.
 
[![Here is an example on how to do it.](https://img.youtube.com/vi/cE5zXT2aP9Y/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/cE5zXT2aP9Y)

In Windows, locate and run the "Windows Powershell". In Windows 10 and above, the Powershell is installed automatically and is the default program.

## The Unix/Linux Filesystem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem

The filesystem appears as one rooted tree of directories.[1] Instead of addressing separate volumes such as disk partitions, removable media, and network shares as separate trees (as done in DOS and Windows: each drive has a drive letter that denotes the root of its file system tree), such volumes can be mounted on a directory, causing the volume's file system tree to appear as that directory in the larger tree.[1] The root of the entire tree is denoted /.

In the original Bell Labs Unix, a two-disk setup was customary, where the first disk contained startup programs, while the second contained users' files and programs. This second disk was mounted at the empty directory named usr on the first disk, causing the two disks to appear as one filesystem, with the second diskâ€™s contents viewable at /usr.

https://linuxfoundation.org/blog/classic-sysadmin-the-linux-filesystem-explained/

## Navigating the filesystem

By default Unix/Linux Terminals will show some basic information to help identify the user the opened the terminal and the system the terminal was opened on. This information can seem trivial on a PC because well we know who we are and on which computer we are running. Yet remmeber that terminals were intially used by multiple users on different shared mainframe computers.

In the video above you can see that my user name (`francopestilli`) and computer names (`francos-mbp`) are reported:

`Last login: Wed Oct 27 21:00:12 on ttys000`

`francopestilli@francos-mbp ~ %`

In addition to that, the data of last login  (`Last login: Wed Oct 27 21:00:12`) is reported. 

![Example of Bash Shell Terminal in Mac OSX (Big Sur early 2022)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119795/151271026-9926f136-9c4a-4f25-b748-3187cc8adce5.png)

#### Useful commands that can be used in the terminal

We can type commands inside the Terminal that will allow us to perform operations on files and folders in the hard drive of the computer. There are many many commands in a Unix/Linux shell, see [here for a few](https://haydenjames.io/90-linux-commands-frequently-used-by-linux-sysadmins/).

In a terminal type:
`pwd` - a.k.a. `P`rint `W`orking `D`irectory. The command will show you the current location on your file system. This is the folder where your terminal would read or write files when requested. 

`ls` - a.k.a. LiSt. The command will show "list" the files and directories in your current directory.

`cd` - a.k.a. Change Directory. The command will allow navigating away from the current directory. For example `cd ..` will move up one directory, or `cd ~` will return to you home directory (the home directory is the one where the terminal generally start when first opeend.

`touch` - a.k.a. Touch a file to create the file. This command will create an empty file with the specified file lane for example: `touch franco.md` will create a file in the current directory with my name and the suffix `.md`.

`mkdir` - a.k.a. Make a Directory. The command will create an empty directory at the specified path, for example: `mkdir ~/franco_dir` will create an empty directory called `francos_dir` in the `home` directory.

`mv` - a.k.a. Move a file. This command will move files (and with advanced options also entire directories).

`rm` - a.k.a. ReMove a file or a directory. This command will delete files and directories (to remove entire directories additional parameters, the video below shows an example on ho wto delete a full folder).

Well these are the basic commands that we will need to use initially to use GitHub locally on our machines using the Linux/Unix terminal. We will learn a few more of them as we move forward with the readings.

Below a short Video that uses the commands above to give you a sense of the outputs. 

[![Using basic commands in the terminal](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zQsChRhwD5Y/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/zQsChRhwD5Y)

#### Let's do something with the terminal

##### (1) Let's make a new folder

###### (1.1) Open a terminal. 

Type `cd ~` to navigate to your home directory (indicated by the symbol `~`).

###### (1.2) Let's take a look at the folders and files we have in the home directory. 

Type `ls -l` This will show all you files and folders. Some of which you might know you have others might be new to you.

The Image below shows all the visible files in the home directory of the computer I am using.
<img width="1643" alt="terminal_windows_OSX_LS" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119795/151272012-d7a4ee97-4393-4773-9b09-8de2ecd86c78.png">

###### (1.3) Let's now create a folder.

Type `mkdir git` this command will create a folder `git` that will use later on to organize the repositories from GitHub.
      
###### (1.4) Navigate inside the folder `git`.

Type `cd git`, the command will change our current location from the home dir (`~`) to the directory we just created. You can check that by typing `pwd` (print working directory), the command will show you the path to the current (working) directory.
      
<img width="1643" alt="terminal_windows_OSX_PWD" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119795/151272499-1a828b1f-3605-4a3d-85d6-38cdba176145.png">

###### (1.5) Create a file inside the folder `git`

 Type `touch readme.md` This will create an empty file inside the current directory, that at this point should be the directory `git`.
      
###### (1.6) Edit the file `readme.md` and use MarkDown to make it informative.
 
 Write a short title using the top heading so to explain what the goal of the folder `git` will be. For example, "Folder for all my GitHub repositories"
 In the second line, write the name, surname, email and GitHub user of the owner of this folder (you), using a smaller headings.
 In the rest of the text describe in plain words what you plan to use this folder for. Hoow you created the folder and the file (describe the commands that you typed in the termial to create the folder `git`, the file `readme.md` and describe how you learned to do this all (hint. Refer to this class and this tutorial).

Note that, opening the file might be different with different computer setup. On my Mac OSX I have the [Apple developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/) installed, so I can type in the terminal `open readme.md` and the file will be opened using Apple Xcode. Alternatively, you can use TextEdit using the graphic interface.

<img width="559" alt="Open_an_MD_file" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119795/151277814-a105a53e-fdea-43b0-8743-66bc282a5ee2.png">


#### A couple of notes. 

###### Note one. The Terminal is programmable and that means customizable. 

All this can be customized because the terminal is programmable, the interface and display of information by default can be chanhed by changing specific configuration files. We will not go over that as it is not relevat for the current topic but here is a couple of good resources [one](https://www.maketecheasier.com/customize-mac-terminal/) and [another, more advanced, one](https://medium.com/@charlesdobson/how-to-customize-your-macos-terminal-7cce5823006e).

###### Note two. Commands have options.

In the previous video video I use additional parameters (a.k.a. options) to generate richer outputs from the commands or to automatically delete folder and the files insdie the folder. You can find out more about how to use a command in Unix/Linux and the available options for the command by typing the comman followed by -h for help, for example `rm -h`

### The UNIX File System Hierarchy

Above, we took a dive into our local file system. We have not really explained what is a File system and how it works. Here we will try to give an introduction to the local file system. We will not aim at being exhaustive but provide a first approximation.

Unix-like operating systems create use a File System with one root directory, and every file existing on the system is located under it somewhere. The structure of the UNIX File system is defined and is called Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). The FHS describes the conventions used for the layout of a UNIX operative system.

Notwithstanding the operative system, all files and folders must be addressed by starting in a specific, "root" directory. This root directory on UNIX/Linux systems is indicated with the symble `/`. The "root" or `/` is where all the files originate. All files and folders are organized under the `/` directory. The image below shows the FHS organized in a visual fashion, `/` is where the Filesystem Hierarchy starts.

<img width="1109" alt="image" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/06/70/ab0670ef648900b04d7a37d7a5b5ba0a.png">

Wikipedia has an nice, longer [article on the FHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard).

#### A look at On Apple's macOS File system

Apple's macOS is a UNIX based system, as such the FHS also exists on macOS.  The command `man hier` typed in a Terminal on an Apple macOS computer should show something that looks like the following image. The image shows the critical top-level directories living under your `root` or `/` directory.

<img width="1109" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119795/187829218-06ee5352-217a-4c88-83ec-046898c5b7c1.png">

macOS simplifies the UNIX FHS for the common users. So, in macOS the visible directory structure (the one any user can easily have access to from the GUI) is slightly different than the Unix/Linux Filesystem Hierarchy. The table below is an extract from [an Article by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW14) that is more exstennsive on the topic. 

The table below reports the top-level directories commonly accessed by a user using the GUI. This file system strcuture hides the underlying, more complex UNIX FHS that still exists on macOS. The UNIX FHS can be seen by typing `man hier` or navigating the filesystem from a terminal using `ls` and `cd`.
 
| Directory | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `/Applications` | The directory where apps and programs the users utilizes are installed. The directory is intended for use by all users of a computer (if you have multiple users they will all see, read and write the programs in this folder. The App Store installs apps purchased by the user in this directory automatically. The directory contains a subdirectory called `Utilities`. This folder contains apps and programs that are intended for use not by the user but by the operative system. |
| `/Library` |  This directory contains components of apps and programs not directly accessed by the user but needed by the Apps or programs use the `Library` directory to store app/program-specific (or system-specific) resources. Each user on a computer will have their distinct `Library` folder. |
| `/Network` |  This directory will show a list of computers visible when the computer is connected to a network. |
| `/System` |  This directory contains the system resources required by Mac OSX to run. These resources are provided by Apple and must not be modified. |
| `/Users` | This directory contains one or more user home directories. The user home directory is where user-related files are stored. A typical userâ€™s home directory includes the following subdirectories: <ul><li>`Applications`â€”Contains user-specific apps.</li><li>`Desktop`â€”Contains the items on the userâ€™s desktop.</li><li>`Documents`â€”Contains user documents and files.</li><li>`Downloads`â€”Contains files downloaded from the Internet.</li><li>`Library`â€”Contains user-specific app files (hidden in Mac OS 10.7 and later).</li><li>`Movies`â€”Contains the userâ€™s video files.</li><li>`Music`â€”Contains the userâ€™s music files.</li><li>`Pictures`â€”Contains the userâ€™s photos.</li><li>`Public`â€”Contains content the user wants to share.</li><li>`Sites`â€”Contains web pages used by the userâ€™s personal site.</li></ul> The preceding directories are for storing user documents and media only. Apps and programs do not write files to the preceding directories unless explicitly directed to do so by the user. The sole exception to this rule is the Library directory, which apps may use to store data files needed to support the current user. Of the subdirectories, only the `Public` directory is accessible by other users on the system. Access to the other directories is restricted by default. |

#### Windows File System

Microsoft Windows (this short reference is relevant for Windows 10, see the [Original Wikipedia Article here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_structure#:~:text=In%20DOS%2C%20Windows%2C%20and%20OS,to%20being%20combined%20as%20one.)) uses a file system strcuture that does not follow the UNIX Hierarchy.  In most Windows 10 installation, the following folders may appear.

| Folder	| Description |
| --- | --- |
| `\PerfLogs` |  May hold Windows performance logs, but on a default configuration, it is empty. |
| `\Program Files` | <ul><li>`32-bit architecture`: All programs (both 16-bit and 32-bit) are installed in this folder.</li><li>`64-bit architecture`: 64-bit programs are installed in this folder.</li></ul> |
| `\Program Files (x86)` | Appears on 64-bit editions of Windows. 32-bit and 16-bit programs are by default installed in this folder, even though 16-bit programs do not run on 64-bit Windows. |
| `\ProgramData` (hidden) |  Contains program data that is expected to be accessed by computer programs regardless of the user account in the context of which they run. For example, a program may store specific information needed to operate DVD recorders or image scanners connected to a computer, because all users use them. Windows itself uses this folder. For example, Windows Defender stores its virus definitions in `\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender`. Programs do not have permission to store files in this folder, but have permission to create subfolders and store files in them. The organization of the files is at the discretion of the developer. |
| `\Users` | User profile folders. This folder contains one subfolder for each user that has logged onto the system at least once. In addition, it has two other folders: `Public` and `Default` (hidden). |
| `\Public` | This folder serves as a buffer for users of a computer to share files. By default this folder is accessible to all users that can log on to the computer. Also, by default, this folder is shared over the network, although anonymous access (i.e. without a valid password-protected user account) to it is denied. This folder contains user data, not program data, meaning that users are expected to be sole decider of what is in this folder and how it is organized. It is unethical for a program to store its proprietary data here. (There are other folders dedicated to program data.) |
| `[username]\AppData` (hidden) | This folder stores per-user application data and settings. The folder contains three subfolders: Roaming, Local, and LocalLow. Roaming is for networked based logins for roaming profiles. Data saved in Roaming will synchronize to the computer when the user logs into that. Local and LocalLow does not sync up with networked computers. |
| `\Windows` |  Windows itself is installed into this folder. <ul><li>`\System` - stores 16-bit DLLs and is normally empty on 64-bit editions of Windows.</li><li>`\System32` -  stores either 32-bit or 64-bit DLL files, depending on whether the Windows edition is 32-bit or 64-bit.</li><li>`\SysWOW64` - Only appears on 64-bit editions of Windows and stores 32-bit DLLs.</li></ul> These folders store dynamic-link library (DLL) files that implement the core features of Windows and Windows API. |   
| `\WinSxS` | This folder is officially called "Windows component store" and constitutes the majority of Windows. A copy of all Windows components, as well as all Windows updates and service packs is stored in this folder. |
