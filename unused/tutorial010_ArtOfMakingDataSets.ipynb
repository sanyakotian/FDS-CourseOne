    "Often a data scientist is in need to think through a problem that a dataset might raise. Thinking data in abstract terms is not easy.

Creating data can help explore how the data might change or vary under different scenarios or hypothesis.\n",

    "For example, imagine having a complex and in important dataset in front of you, a very difficult problem, too much data and very noisy data. After plotting and describing the datasetand as we have done in Tutorials 7 and 8, the Data Scientist formulates an hypothesis about the dataset. Now the dataset is so big and noisy that working directly with the dataset is slow and tedious and access to better computing facility is not possible. So the Data Scientist thinks: \"Maybe I can generate a smaller dataset with the properties of the big dataset, just to thing through things and look at whether the pattern that the simulated dataset shows is similar to the big dataset i was given to study.\" Generating a dataset that is small and easy to work with and look at would really fcilitate the work of the Data Scientst. This process is called data simulation and we will explore more of this later in the course. For now let's think a specific example."

    "ADAS detected a large increase in heat and pollution on Earth by using a **Heat Sensitive Proxiscope (HeatSPro)**. The HeatSPro pattern follows the sun-light cycle, yet, the measurements show higher heat on earth than predicted by sunlight alone. The increase in heat goes just a little bit beyond what is predicted by the increase in heat due to the sunlight, and given how difficult it is to measure from hearth the measurements fade in. ADAS thinks this might be due to the activity of living organisms on earth that might be moving around and perhaps even burning elements on earth. ADAS hypothesizes that the discrepancy between the heat pattern predicted by the Sun cycle and the measurement could a first demonstration of life on earth. ADAS understands that each organism can only burn little and contribute very little to the HeatSPro measurements.  But ADAS thinks that if enough organisms exist on earth perhaps enough heat might be generated so that the pattern of heat measured by the HeatSPro might be explained by life on earth. \n",
