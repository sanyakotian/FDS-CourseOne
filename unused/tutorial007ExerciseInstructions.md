### Exercise 007!

#### The situation
There is a virus sweeping the globe (Ha! Like that would ever happen! But let's pretend...). You have data on the mutation rates of 4 different strains of the virus (in mutations per generation x 10e-5). You need to determine if the 4 strains mutate at generally the same rate, and can thus be treated as one in epidemiological models, or if they are different enough that they must be modeled separately.  

#### Your mission:

* make an informative histogram of the mutation rates of the 4 strains.
* ditto but using a KDE plot
* make a violin plot of the data
* make a boxplot of the data
* make a boxplot with an overlaid strip chart

Finally, select the plot from above that you're going to show to Anthony Fauci to make your point. Make sure that the axis labels or legend entries or whatever are in English not code (e.g. "Mutation Rates" not "Mutation_Rate"). And make your point!
