### File I/O exercise


#### Download exercise data file

For this exercise, you can just download the [tutorial006 exercise .csv file from Canvas into your local datasets folder (this folder should have been created under `/Users/YourUserName/GitHub/PythonTutorials/datasets` if you followed the instrctions for tutoria006).

Then you can start your own brand-new notebook in your tutorials folder (which should be – needs to be – the parent directory of the datasets folder.

#### Your mission!

So here's the deal. The lab where you work uses low temperature freezers ("minus 80s" in the biz) to store biological samples. The data are temperature records from two freezers, Freezer 4 and Freezer 2. Your boss has asked to check if she should be worried about either of the freezers.

Once you've downloaded the data, you mission is to

* load the data into a pandas data frame

* make pretty histograms of the two distribution

* make pretty KDE plots of the two distributions

* summarize the data (means, etc.)

* write your data summary out to a new file

* read you summary back in, and visually confirm somehow that the read was successful!

So what do you think? Are both freezers functioning nominally?

#### Commit and push your work to GitHub

Now that you've done all that work, commit it and push your repo to the cloud where it can bask for all eternity!

#### Submit!

Finally, print out your notebook as a .pdf file and submit it via Canvas!
