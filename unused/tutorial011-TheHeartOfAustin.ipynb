    "# Simulating the effects of exercise on sleep quality\n",
    "The overall understanding, is that physical activity (exercise) improves night-sleep quality. For example, this is one study that shows a relationship between physical exercise and sleep quality: [Singh and colleagues, *Sleep* (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/20.2.95). \n",

    "#### Overall goal of the simulation\n",
    "Our goal will be to simulate 10, 25-years old, individuals that have participated in a 1-week sleep wellness plan. The participants will exercise once a day for 2 hour. We will measure how well they felt they sleeped each night following an exercise. More specifically, for each individual, the mean HR across 7 days during the exercise will be correlated with the mean measure of quality of sleep also across the 7 days.\n",
