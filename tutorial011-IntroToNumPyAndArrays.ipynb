    "Data scientists spend a lot of time – wait for it – working with ***data***! To work with **data** it is critical to organize the data in a way that facilitate the work on the potential analyses we might need to do. So organizing data means guessing what type of work we will want to do with the dataset. And, odd is it may seem, good guessing requires some practice. The data organization process will require: \n",
    "\n",
    "* store the data a clear and systematic way\n",
    "* provide methods to access the data that are simple and straightforward\n",
    "* be flexible enough so to and allow to modify the format of the data for various needs\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already met a data container that is commonly used and that we will ultimately be using a lot: the Pandas DataFrame. So far, we have imported data directly into a DataFrame, have passed that DataFrame to plotting functions, and then accessed columns of data using the column names. We have even seen that DataFrames \"know\" how to plot the data inside them. In more technical terms this means that the DataFrame is an object that have basic methods to plot and explore the data it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to really understand and use DataFrames, it is of great help to understand and use what they are built upon, which are the `numpy arrays`. Numpy arrays are grids or tables for holding, accessing, and manipulating data. DataFrames are literally built on top of numpy arrays, providing many bells and whistles, such as column names, neat formatting, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays are simpler than Pandas DataFrames. They are created and accessed in ways that are very similar to the ways Python `lists` can be accessed. Lists are among the simplest most  built-in data containers. This is no accident of course; if you can work with one, then it's easy to work with the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we are going to do is to learn how to work with `lists` (lists are handy!), then we will graduate to `numpy arrays` and see what they can do. Finally, we'll step back up to `DataFrames` – with our newfound understanding of what's under the hood – in this and the next tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all this, you will be `Masters of data` or at least know more about Python."
