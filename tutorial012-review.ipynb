The Fibonacci sequence, first documented as early as 400 BC, is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)...`. This sequence is famously related to the `golden ratio`, which has been found in many aspects of life including the distribution of flower pedals on a flower to the beautiful artwork coming from the great Renaissance painters!\n",
